We need a virtual casino web application.  It needs to simulate what it would be like for someone at a regular casino.  It should offer some basic casino games, and the ability to maintain a chip balance between all games.

The application should be responsive and not laggy in any way.

Users should be able to change games at any point.

We don't want to tie the chips that the players (users) have to any form of money or value in the real world.  This application is really just a space where users can try out different games.  Think of it as "paper trading" for gambling.

As an initial MVP, we'd like the application to support:
- user authentication (the only method needs to be email and password for now)
- a user can request a line of credit from the casino cashier (get chips for free) in order to populate their bankroll
  - the user cannot request credit above a certain limit
  - the user cannot request more chips if their current bankroll is above the limit
- a user can view their current bankroll
- if the user runs out (i.e. not able to make the minimum bet requirement at a game), then they have to leave the game and go back to the casino cashier to get more credit
- a user can play at least one simple casino game (either a simple slots game or blackjack) and utilize their bankroll in the game
